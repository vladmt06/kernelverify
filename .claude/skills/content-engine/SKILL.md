# Content Engine

Turn one idea into strong content for each platform. Don't cross-post the same thing.

## When to Use

- Writing X posts or threads
- LinkedIn posts or launch updates
- Short-form video scripts
- Turning articles or demos into social content
- Building a content plan around a launch

> See `examples.md` for platform-specific post examples showing the same idea adapted for X, LinkedIn, and newsletter.

## First Questions

Ask:
- Source: What are we working from?
- Audience: Builders, investors, customers, or general?
- Platform: X, LinkedIn, TikTok, YouTube, newsletter, or all?
- Goal: Awareness, conversion, recruiting, or engagement?

## Setup

If the user runs this skill often, store preferences in a `content-config.json`:

```json
{
  "defaultPlatforms": ["x", "linkedin"],
  "brandVoice": "direct and technical",
  "audience": "developers and technical founders",
  "avoidWords": ["excited", "thrilled", "game-changer"],
  "hashtagPolicy": "max 2 per post"
}
```

Read this config at the start of every content session. Skip the "First Questions" step for any field that's already configured.

## Rules

1. Adapt for each platform. Don't copy-paste.
2. Hooks matter more than summaries.
3. One clear idea per post.
4. Use specifics, not slogans.
5. Keep the ask small and clear.

## Platform Tips

### X
- Open fast
- One idea per tweet
- Keep links out of the body
- No hashtag spam

### LinkedIn
- Strong first line
- Short paragraphs
- More framing around lessons and results

### TikTok / Short Video
- First 3 seconds must grab attention
- Script around visuals
- One demo, one claim, one CTA

### YouTube
- Show the result early
- Structure by chapters
- New visual every 20-30 seconds

### Newsletter
- One clear theme
- Skimmable section titles
- Opening paragraph does real work

## Repurposing Flow

1. Start with one anchor piece (article, video, demo)
2. Pull out 3-7 separate ideas
3. Write platform-native version of each
4. Cut overlap between posts
5. Match CTAs to each platform

## Interaction Style

**No BS. Honest feedback only.**

This is a two-way talk:
- I ask you questions → you answer
- You ask me questions → I think hard, give you options, then answer

**When I ask you a question, I always:**
1. Think about it first
2. Give you 2-3 options with my honest take on each
3. Tell you which one I'd pick and why
4. Then ask what you think

**When you ask me something:**
- I give you a straight answer
- I tell you if a hook is weak or a post won't land
- I push for platform-native content, not lazy cross-posts

**Never:**
- Ask a question without giving options
- Write generic hooks like "Here's what I learned..."
- Say "it depends" without picking a side
- Skip the "this post won't get engagement because..." feedback
- Let hype language into social content

## Gotchas

- **Cross-posting is lazy and it shows.** A LinkedIn post copy-pasted to X looks like spam. Every platform has different norms — adapt the format, length, and hook.
- **Weak hooks sink good content.** "Here's what I learned about X" is invisible on any feed. Open with tension, a number, or a contrarian take.
- **Corporate-speak kills engagement.** "We're excited to announce" gets zero engagement. Say what you did, what happened, and why it matters.
- **Too many CTAs = no action.** Pick one CTA per post. "Like, share, comment, and sign up" is noise. One clear ask.
- **Hashtag spam on LinkedIn and X is counterproductive.** 1-3 relevant hashtags max. A wall of hashtags signals low-quality content.

## Before You Deliver

- Each draft fits its platform
- Hooks are specific, not generic
- No hype language
- CTAs match the content and audience
