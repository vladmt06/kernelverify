# kernelverify agent instructions

These are the instructions specific to this repository.
Vlad's global instructions still apply; this file adds the project's layout, how it runs, its working rules, and the mistakes already encountered.

## What this project is

- kernelverify is a GPU-kernel correctness verifier.
  It exists because LLM-generated GPU kernels routinely pass the benchmarks that ship with them while being wrong, which the paper "The Correctness Illusion in LLM-Generated GPU Kernels" (arXiv 2606.20128) documented and whose gpuemu corpus we vendor.
- The strategy has two phases.
  First build the verifier, then build the optimiser that generates faster kernels for open-weight models (Llama, Qwen) with the verifier gating every candidate.
  Vlad's Mac (Metal backend) is a first-class optimiser target alongside server GPUs.
- The core reframing: escape is a property of the pair (bug, test case), not of a bug alone.
  The differentiator: test policies are scored by mutation against a synthesised fault population that provably contains the published corpus faults.
- The current battery covers three axes: shape and dtype, input scale, and structured input modes (opposed signs, near zero, constant rows).
  The shipped policy is boundary coverage of single features, then feature pairs, then random exploration; it catches 100% of the viable fault population at 16 evaluations per operator.

## Layout

- `kernelverify/reference/kernels.py` - parameterised kernels, correct by default; keyword seams introduce faults.
  Single source for both the corpus ports and the mutation catalogue, so the synthetic fault space provably contains the published faults.
- `kernelverify/mutation/catalogue.py` - the fault catalogue (44 entries), corpus faults marked `from_corpus`.
- `bench/cpu_ports.py` - corpus kernel name to parameterisation mapping, plus each buggy kernel's correct control.
- `bench/measure_escape.py` - escape-rate measurement against the vendored corpus.
  Frozen: reruns must reproduce the ADR 0001 tables exactly.
- `bench/score_oracles.py` - mutation scoring of test policies at equal budget B.
- `bench/probe_bottleneck.py` - one-off probe of where a given fault is detectable; rerun it whenever the catalogue grows.
- `docs/adr/` - decisions with the measurements that forced them.
  Read these before changing any method.
- `vendor/gpuemu-corpus/` - vendored unmodified at the commit pinned in `vendor/PINNED.txt`.
  Never edit anything under `vendor/`.
- Empty packages (`battery`, `detectors`, `runners`, ...) are planned components, not dead code.

## Running

```
cd /Users/vlad/kernelverify
.venv/bin/python bench/measure_escape.py   # ~1 min, must reproduce ADR 0001
.venv/bin/python bench/score_oracles.py    # ~1 min warm, ~5 min after a catalogue change
```

- Verdicts are cached at `bench/.cache/verdicts.pkl`, fingerprinted by mutation names and input modes; any catalogue or mode change rebuilds automatically.
- Deleting `bench/.cache/` is the safe full reset.

## Working rules for this repo

- Every method change needs a measurement behind it and an ADR entry recording what forced it.
  Pre-register the next upgrade and adopt it only when a measured miss demands it, the way ADR 0002 pre-registered pairwise coverage and ADR 0003 adopted it.
- Never cite the corpus's `benchmark_verdict` fields as evidence; they are hardcoded "pass" and were never computed.
- Any 100% claim must be backed by exact miss counts, not by a rounded table cell.
- Grow the fault catalogue faster than the policy adapts; the numbers stay honest only while the population outpaces the tuning.
- Excluding a mutation as equivalent requires a stated reason for why no oracle could ever see it.
- Test policies must never reference a known fault; they may only use the operator schema, dtypes, and input modes.
- Never add AI co-author attribution to commits.

## Mistakes already encountered

- The shell cwd resets between tool calls, so `cd /Users/vlad/kernelverify` in every command.
- The verdict cache stores plain tuples, not dataclasses, because pickled dataclasses remember their defining module and break when loaded from an import context.
- Structured input modes can make a correct fp32 kernel exceed the published tolerance against the fp64 reference.
  That is ill-conditioning, not a port bug: such cases count as no-evidence, never as detections, and only control failures on iid modes mean the port is wrong.
- Table cells rounded to whole percents once overstated a result (99.8% shown as 100%); keep one decimal and verify exact counts for any 100.0% cell.
- A deterministic-only test policy plateaued at 88% while random reached 98%; exploration must survive in any policy.
- Pure pair-greedy coverage cratered to 67% at B=4 by buying pair density before basic diversity; cover single features first, then pairs, then random.
- The corpus fp64 references run as subprocesses over a stdin/stdout protocol; they are the slow part of any rebuild, so batch and cache around them.
